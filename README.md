# DosBossV2
Do you program in Assembly using TASM, TLINK and TD (Turbo Assembler, Turbo Link, Turbo Debugger)<br>
and tired of openning DosBox and writing the same, long 3 commands over and over?<br>
<b>DosBossV2</b><br>
Written in Batch, only type the ASM file name and DosBoss will run it for you.
<br><br>
<b>How To Use</b><br>
Just run DosBoss V2.bat and type your ASM file name.<br>
If you want to use Turbo Debugger, run Dosboss V2 td.bat<br><br>
Developed for windows, works for Mac using Wine and changing a few lines of code.<br>Did you try it on Linux
and it worked? tell me and I'll update
